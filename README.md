# Machine Learning Models


This lesson aims to show you how machine learning algorithms work under the hood.

The notion of object-oriented programming is also covered, which can be difficult when you are for the first time faced with it. Don't hesitate to ask us to explain any notion you don't understand yet. 

We also encourage you to look at the solutions; if you are stuck on a particular point, we will be there to explain it to you.

Finally, consider this course as a discussion and the notebook as support to exchange ideas.
